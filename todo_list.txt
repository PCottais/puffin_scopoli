SCHEDULE
 - practice before the day of presentation (10 days before)
 - after one week: switch to real data
 test : explain how mouvement is (draw graph by simulating)

TO-DO LIST
 1rst step : simutate data and then inference (understand what's behind infernece process)
	- verify if movements are coherent (vary number of steps,
	check the magnitude of the animal's choice of cell (available probabilities))
	- deal with border issues by adding 0 to "exp() grid-landscape"
	- include Beta
=> Done

 2nd step : Check how to use clogit function in amt package
 	  - Recreate the simulation and run clogit again with available steps as 0, used step as 1
	  - Read the new document
 3rd step: explore Scopoli shearwaters data
